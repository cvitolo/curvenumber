\title{Calculate Curve Number for soil (HOST) and vegetation (LCM) maps}
\usage{
RegionalisedCN(
  soil,
  catchment,
  lookupTable,
  vegetation,
  artificialDrainage = "none"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{soil}{filename of a shapefile containing the percentage coverage of HOST classes}

\item{catchment}{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame containing a single catchment boundary to be used as mask to crop the raster.}

\item{lookupTable}{this is a data.frame to link soil, vegetation and Hydrological conditions.}

\item{vegetation}{filename of a raster containing the vegetation map.}

\item{artificialDrainage}{(default = "none"), possible values are none, low, medium, high.}
}
\value{
Regionalised Curve Number for a given catchment, this is an integer in the range [0,100] with 0 = no runoff and 100 = all rainfall becomes runoff.
}

}
\details{
Please make sure that soil, catchment and vegetation are projected in the same Coordinate Reference System (for info see http://spatialreference.org/).
