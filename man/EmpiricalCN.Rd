\title{Calculate the Curve Number from time series data (P and Q)}
\usage{
EmpiricalCN(
  tseries,
  stepsBack = 5,
  hours2extend = 6,
  timeUnits = "hours",
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tseries}{time series object containing, at least, precipitation ("P") and discharge ("Q")}

\item{stepsBack}{timesteps to use to generate the linear model for the volume under the rising limb (default = 5)}

\item{hours2extend}{number of hours to extend the rainfall event to account for the discharge peak to occur (default = 6)}

\item{timeUnits}{time step units (default = "hours")}

\item{verbose}{(optional) boolean (FALSE by default). If TRUE prints the progress in terms of event number.}
}
\value{
Empirical Curve Number for a given catchment, this is an integer in the range [0,100] with 0 = no runoff and 100 = all rainfall becomes runoff.
