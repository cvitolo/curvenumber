\title{Calculate Base Flow Index (BFI) map from soil (HOST) map}
\usage{
RegionalisedBFIdominant(soil, catchment, lookupTable)
}
\arguments{
\item{soil}{filename of a raster containing the dominant soil classes (HOST).}

\item{catchment}{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame containing a single catchment boundary to be used as mask to crop the raster.}

\item{lookupTable}{A dataframe containing as many rows as the number of soil classes and at least two columns (named "HOSTclass" and "BFIHOST").}
}
\value{
Regionalised BFI number for a given catchment, this is in the range [0,1] and is calculated only using dominant soil classes.
}
